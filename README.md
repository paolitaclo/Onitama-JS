q1 project Galvanize: Onitama JS
Onitama Js is a two player game in which each player has 5 pawns: one master (RR or BB depending on the color the player choose) and his 4 disciples.

The way a player can win is either by capturing the opponent’s master or by taking your master and positioned it in the opponent’s master  where it started.

At the beginning of the game the player who starts is selected randomly and the color (blue or red) is showed on the board.

During a player’s turn, the player has two cards (on the bottom of the board), each card shows the possible moves a pawn can do. The player select one of the two cards and he can see on the board by hovering on each pawns, where he can move the piece. Once the player decided which card will use to play and which pawn will move, clicks on the pawn selected and he will see (in pink) the possible destinations, then the player clicks on the destination selected and the pawn will move to it.  Finally the player finish his turn by clicking on the DONE button, and is turn for the next player.
